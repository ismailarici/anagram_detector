# anagram_detector
This repo is for an anagram finder code

Anagram: Two words are anagrams if they have the same letters, counting for multiplicity, but 
in a different order. For example, “plane” and “nepal” are anagrams because each contains one “n”,
one “e”, one “p”, one "a" and one “l”. 

#is_anagram file contains code to check if any given words are anagrams or not

#anagram_detector file contains code which gets sample_text.txt as input and finds all the anagrams within the document
